    <p>The Goldfish Cleanse, (also known as <i>the diet</i>) rests and relieves the digestive system, allowing the body to heal and eliminate toxins. It also produces significant weight loss in a safe and efficient manner.</p>

    <p>Much like the intravenous solutions that doctors use to help heal wounded people, The Goldfish Cleanse works internally to help your body function normally by removing toxins. It also allows your digestive system to slow down and conserve energy. The body moves from constantly working against negativity after it eliminates the toxins that have collected in your body for years.</p>

    <p>Of the many benefits of The Goldfish Cleanse, the two most popular are the safe and rapid weight loss and the resulting added energy. While mild cold-like symptoms may be experienced on The Goldfish Cleanse, they are only temporary, and if present, these symptoms generally decrease as the diet progress...unless they don't. This reflects the rate and quantity of toxins being eliminated from the body.</p>

    <p>The Goldfish Cleanse was designed as a simple and effective plan that anyone can follow. The ingredients to the diet are few in number and simple, but as they are organic, they may not be available at just any supermarket. Your local organic supermarket should have what you need.</p>

    <p>The Goldfish Cleanse also offers pre-packaged kits and accessories that will give you everything you need to master your experience.</p>
